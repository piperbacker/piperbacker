Hi, I'm Piper ✨
<br>
I'm a frontend developer and I love to design interfaces that surprise and dazzle in small, joyful ways.

# Projects
Some of my projects include [my portfolio website](https://github.com/piperbacker/piperbacker.github.io) and the [toodoo chrome extension](https://github.com/piperbacker/toodoo-chrome-ext)

Most recently I've been working with typescript and react.
